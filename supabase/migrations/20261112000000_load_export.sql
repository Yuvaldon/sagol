-- =============================================================================
-- Loading a local export into the backend, once, on the server (OI-109, D-206).
--
-- An organization that started on the local adapter moves to the backend as stored: every row
-- with its audit columns, its leave history and its account links. Not a path for users around
-- the commands (D-050, D-171): only the database owner runs it, from the SQL editor or psql:
--
--   SELECT load_organization_export(pg_read_file(...)::jsonb);   -- or the file's text, pasted
--
-- One statement writes every table, so the foreign keys, which form cycles (an organization's
-- baseline role, every row's created_by soldier), are checked once, after every row is in. Units go
-- parents first, so the triggers derive unit_closure; leave events go in their stored order, and the
-- order trigger moves a tie a millisecond later, as on every server write (the local adapter keeps ties).
